This page is only intended to provide one more element of discussion, to the [previous session](https://github.com/productfed/product-practice/blob/main/05%20More%20effective%20epics.md).

##

With epics, it is useful and productive to have ways for making them more visible within the tools that we use.

It is more than visual representation. It is about having a quick and easy way to find them and to discuss them.

There are three things that I find particularly helpful, and I will briefly discuss them here below.

#### 1. Find a scoring system

I always look at ways for prioritising.

The two classification I generally use are:
  - urgent, high, medium, low
  - must do, should do, could do, won't do

I use those metrics almost as grades, from A to D.

This helps me to immediately understand and communicate what are the highest vs lowest priority epics.

I use this approach consistently.

I make sure to periodically review and update accordingly.


#### 2. Establish an order

Having a scoring system, allows me to create my own order of deliverables.

For ordering my epics, I also take into account another factor: risk.

So I go and add an indicator for high, medium, low risk.

The combination between the priority metric and the risk metric, generally decides my order.

I may take into consideration some extra factors. Management's requests could be an example.


#### 3. Look out for the hidden epics

I have often found myself in situations when many stories were either assigned to the wrong epic, or did not have any at all.

That, to me, is a potential indicator for hidden epics.

Hidden epics are those ones that do not exist yet, but many stories hint to.

Always keep an attentive eye for commonalities and patterns.

Especially for existing or long running epics, scope might have creeped. You may have new stories who actually deserve their own epic as they are all trying to solve a new specific problem.
