Amongs the topics discussed:
1) the "no meetings" Friday can be affected by more emails. Should one reply soon?
2) block some time for pre-planning
3) schdule your day to your best interest
4) stack, if possible "back to back", or do the opposite if your brain works better with frequent breaks
5) unplug from some channels, as long as you feel comfortable to do so. Don't be afraid to switch off and make sure your team knows
6) Focus Time:
  - define daily tasks
  - split tasks into steps
  - assign each step to one "Focus Time" working session
  - set the timer to 30 minutes
  - take 5 minutes break
  - move to the next Focus Time
7) Pomodoro technique
  - 25 minutes chunks
  - take 5 minutes breaks
  - repeat 3 times
  - after that, increase breaks to 10, 15 and 20 minutes between each chunk of time
  - doesn't require planning your tasks
8) my experience with those techniques, what does and does not work for me, and why
9) "Focus Plan" Microsoft integration
10) "Outlook calendar" Slack extension
11) My suggestions for achieving optimal efficiency:
  - group similar tasks together, reduce the "context switch" effort
  - be considerate of the time of day you feel more productive and schedule accordingly
  - use meeting notes and, if necessary, notetakers
  - colour code your calendar (if you can) by themes
  - block time to adjust your calendar
  - use "blocker slots" for your own benefit
  - resting is important, plan for it as well
