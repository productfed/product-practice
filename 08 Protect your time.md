Your time is precious, and you need to protect it.

It sounds like an obvious and simple concept. In reality, we often end up being busy with many activities, at the expense of the time that we should deserve to perform other productive tasks.

##

Here below are some considerations on a few concepts, techniques and tools that can help protecting your time.


#### 1. The "no meetings" day can be affected by more emails. Should one reply soon?

Short answer is no.

A more elaborate answer is: no, as it risks to establish a negative pattern. But replying may be worth or even necessary.

Some companies put in place this policy as they are affected by too many meetings. Some companies use it as they believe it helps people being more focussed. Some other companies use it as it sounds cool.

So then the dilemma is: what about all the other communication tools? Emails, direct messages, team channels. You may see people trying to reach out more consistently, via those asynchronous tools.

The reality is that communicating is a need, but the key is setting expectations.

If your business, regardless from the reason, has decided to implement such a habit, you need to build the right patterns for what happens to all the rest.

It is unproductive to entail in a 30 minutes back and fort written conversation, if you could discuss it easier on a 10/15 minutes call.

It is also very damaging, for your own focus, having to constantly check your inbox or other media tools, for the fear of missing out on a reply.

Prioritise what matters and do not feel forced to reply soon to everything.

Some things may be very time sensitive. Instruct people to contact you on a specific channel of preference, if they have to ask you for a high priority thing. Make that a habit, and share it widely with your coworkers, so that everyone is aware.


#### 2. Block some time for pre-planning

Planning activities, especially when it is about backlog planning, are time and effort consuming.

Ideally, you would want to get into a planning session with a low degree of ambiguity of your backlog items.

Therefore, it is very useful to block some time, as much as you need, to refine or investigate more about those stories, so that when you present them to the team, the "what" and the "why" are as clear as possible.


#### 3. Schedule your day to your best interest

Schedule the most important activities, the ones that require your highest degrees of focus, away from any distraction.

If people are inviting you to a meeting that is important, but it would be very disruptive to your schedule:
- ask them to re-schedule
- re-arrange your own calendar accordingly

This is to make it so you allow yourself time to get ready for these session and ease the context switching fatigue.


#### 4. Stack, if possible "back to back", or do the opposite if your brain works better with frequent breaks

You may be one of those people who work at their best if they have no interruptions. If so, schedule as many sequential activities as possible.

If instead, you struggle with long periods of engagement in meetings and activities, set the habit of taking substantial breaks, to recharge your energy.


#### 5. Unplug from some channels, as long as you feel comfortable to do so. Don't be afraid to switch off and make sure your team knows

Being always available on Slack (as an example), might not be in yours or the team's best interest.

You may be affected by multiple interruptions and unsolicited requests, and you may lose your focus.

If you are feeling the pain, stop it, get some relief. Establish for instance "core hours", where people can reach out to you. Do not reply on that media outside those core hours, to set a habit and an example.

If you want to try and follow this pattern, do it incrementally. Do not just disappear from one channel for one entire day without communicating it to anyone, it would set the exercise for failure.

Test it, see if it works, see if you are missing out. Often, it is exactly that fear that pushes us to feel the need of being constantly available. It is unnecessary, unless for valid and self contained reasons.


#### 6. Focus Time

  - define daily tasks
  - split tasks into steps
  - assign each step to one "Focus Time" working session
  - set the timer to 30 minutes
  - take 5 minutes break
  - move to the next Focus Time

#### 7. Pomodoro technique

  - 25 minutes chunks
  - take 5 minutes breaks
  - repeat 3 times
  - after that, increase breaks to 10, 15 and 20 minutes between each chunk of time
  - doesn't require planning your tasks

#### 8. My experience with the above techniques, what does and does not work for me, and why

I am a natural born planner. I work at best when I plan my activities, my tasks and my time. This applies to work, as much as in my own private life.

When I tried the Pomodoro technique, it did not work for me, at all, for the following reasons:
- no planning required meant I kept going back and fort between my tasks, struggling to decide on what to do first
- I was not able to achieve anything particularly productive in 25 minutes, too short time for me to really focus and deep dive

When I tried the Focus Time technique, I was comfortable in having a solid breakdown of tasks into steps, but I still encountered the following issues:
- 30 minutes worked for some tasks, but I was not able to break down other things into the same timeframe. Forcing myself to stop, pause for a few minutes, and re-start, meant that every time it took me twice the effort to become productive again
- Taking only 5 minutes break was ok for the first couple of session, but was not enough for the following ones

Both techniques though, gave me something that I constantly use:
- I take incremental breaks
- I split down tasks into steps
- I block a set amount of time, usually no less than 1 hour, to stay focussed


#### 9. "Focus Plan" Microsoft integration

If your company uses Microsoft Outlook, you can try their [Focus Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/viva/insights/personal/use/focus-plan#to-create-your-focus-plan) integration to bring some automation in your time protected activities. It comes with some limitations but you may want to test it for a bit.


#### 10. "Calendar" Slack extensions

If your company uses Slack, you can try a calendar extension, available both for [Google](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/206329808-Google-Calendar-for-Slack) and [Microsoft](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360020134853-Microsoft-Outlook-Calendar-for-Slack) accounts, so that you can automatically set statuses according to your schedule. This will facilitate your interactions with your coworkers and will help managing expectations in terms of response time.

You can find an official high-level list for Slack automated integrations [here](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/categories/360000047926). It may be useful also for other tools that you use on a daily basis.


#### 11. My "best" suggestions for achieving optimal efficiency

  - group similar tasks together, reduce the "context switch" effort
  - be considerate of the time of day you feel more productive and schedule accordingly
  - use meeting notes and, if necessary, notetakers
  - colour code your calendar (if you can) by themes
  - block time to adjust your calendar
  - use "blocker slots" for your own benefit
  - resting is important, plan for it as well
