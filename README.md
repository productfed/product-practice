# product-practice
A list of suggestions for how to improve certain aspects of the product practice.

- 01: How to better structure the Product backlog
- 02: How to improve clarity for priorities within the Product backlog
- 03: How to help the team with the fact that there are too many different topics in one sprint, and when a pair works on a single topic, it’s hard for the other team members to keep up with what’s happening and why
- 04: How to deal with long running epics, having 4 or 5 epics in different topics, and what to do when they need to run in parallel
- 05: How to better express a definition of done for epics, while improving the way we define end goals
- 06: How to arrange epics in a better way within your tools
- 07: How to improve confidence for teams, to be able to push back or delay according to priorities (more freedom in less high-level items)
- 08: How to better protect your valuable time
- 09: How to improve the awareness around business relevance and kind of customers the team is helping with their valuable work
- 10: How to improve the components’ responsibility awareness and how to ease the chain of support

## Why this exists and what to do with it
I have created this list to support pairing activities with Product Managers/Owners.

The above list is not meant to be exhaustive.

Please treat it as a living document, subject to updates.

All contributions are welcome.
