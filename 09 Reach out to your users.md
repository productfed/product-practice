The following is a set of recommendations, that may sound obvious.

Yet, the reality of the day to day life in medium to complex organisations, may push us away from them.

When it comes about users, no matter if external or internal, their voice should matter.

As product professionals, we have a duty to represent that voice, within the business.

This is not because of "best practice". It is in our interest, in their interest, and in the interest of the business we work for.

There are six things that we can do, to make it so we stay as close to their needs as possible.

#### 1. Reach out

Some users may experience difficulties or issues, in reaching out to the right team. In some cases, internal dynamics and structures may even make it impossible, or prevent it. Other users, may instead have easier routes to get in contact.

In both cases, they would only do it when they need. Which represents a wasted opportunity for the business.

This is why it is important to be proactive and reach out to them.


#### 2. Involve them

Involving users as early as possible and as often as possible, speeds up the development process.

There is nothing worse than writing hundreds of lines of code, to realise only at the very end that it does not meet user needs.

It causes frustration for everyone in the team, and it is a waste of money and time for the business.

This is why it is important to find formats and ways to make users contribute to your piece of work.

It could be through:
- feedback forms, where you ask specific questions with more open ended options (qualitative data)
- pair programming
- regression testing
- surveys forms, where you ask specific questions with a limited number of options (quantitative data)
- [user research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_research)
- workshopping activities, where you involve them into the thinking phase of the process, which may influence the next direction or steps of your product

Choose what would work better for your team according to the available skills. Test, iterate, stop if necessary.


#### 3. Listen to them

At times, taking user feedback on board is challenging.

Some of that feedback may come from frustration with the current product/system. However, it could also originate from serious challenges or problems, that for whatever reason are not evident to us.

Regardless on how hard it can be, focus on the most constructive and practical actions you can take.

Where users see problems, acknowledge them, investigate them and test them. If appropriate, turn them into opportunities.


#### 4. Favour show&tells rather than emails

Activities that allow for direct interaction with users, are better than written communication.

Running a 30 minutes show&tell and allowing an extra 5/10 minutes for questions, is more valuable than sending a slide deck via email.

It may seem more time consuming, but when miscommunication happens, time piles up fast.

Show&tells are probably more valuable to internal users, rather than external ones. However, if you consider your customer as an end user, then, don't be afraid to include them as well.


#### 5. Encourage your most proactive team members

If you have some team members that you observe being more eager to talk to users, encourage them to do it more.

They may not have the time to do this at all stages of the development process, but when they do, do not miss out.

Make sure they do it through the team's official channels. You must prevent the risk that someone reaches team members on private media or out of working hours.


#### 6. Give them some space to drive and share with the rest of the team

It is a great opportunity to have people who care about users, and it is fair to allow them more time to do it.

Prioritise their tasks accordingly and invite them to run show&tell session within the team.

Foster the sense of inclusion and participation in those activities. There is a high probability that more people will become passionate about users as well.
