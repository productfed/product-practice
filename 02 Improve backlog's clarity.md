Making sure that the priorities in your product backlog are clear to everyone, is a non trivial responsibility.

This is not about making sure that you prioritise the backlog correctly. This is about making sure that everyone has a solid understanding on why some items are higher priority than others.


##

Here below are eight things to consider, that should help you in reaching that goal.

You may not be able to apply them all, or you may have tried some already. Either way, test them and see if they work for you and your team.

Keep what works, discard anything else.


#### 1. Reduce redundancies

You do not need items that are no longer useful in your backlog.

Some of those items might be so outdated that they do not represent the current reality.

You also do not need duplicates, or stories who are actually trying to solve the same problem.

Delete everything that is not needed. Merge everything that may be pertinent to other stories.

This will help you reduce ambiguity. It will help you make priorities clearer.


#### 2. Do sprint kick-offs with your team

Treat the beginning of a new sprint, in the same way you should treat a user story.

Do a kick-off for each sprint, take 30 minutes to explain the core goals. Match the goals with the business strategy. Explain how your work will benefit your customers.


#### 3. Do epics kick-offs with your team

Treat the creation of an epic, in the same way you should treat a user story.

Explain your team why that epic is important and what is the problem that it is trying to solve.

Contextualise the epic amongst all the other epics, and be clear on why it is necessary to have a new one. You will increase your team awareness. They will be able to challenge your assumptions, if needed.


#### 4. Establish epic owners

Identify one of your team members as epic owner. Make it so they become the expert on that specific epic.

Make sure they mentor all the other team members. An epic owner should ideally not work on user stories, but should guide anyone who works on those stories, with their knowledge and expertise.

Epic owners also represent the memory of that epic, in case documentation is not in use.


#### 5. Set labels for next quarters

Use specific labels for each specific quarter, if that helps you categorising issues.

It should help your team as well. It would provide a more immediate visualisation of what is or is not in scope for the quarter.


#### 6. Have 1:1 meetings with your team

Take the time to have regular, 25 minutes, 1:1 meetings with each team member.

It will give them an opportunity to provide you feedback outside the group.

It should help more introvert people to raise concerns or ideas.

It should help you to clarify any questions on the current planning and direction of the product.

You should decide the cadence, I would suggest every two weeks.


#### 7. Do show & tells

Whenever you have new business information of relevance for the team, do a quick show & tell.

Do not wait for the creation of epics or the start of a sprint. Get the team familiar with incoming challenge or opportunities, as soon as you see fit.

You can also decide to make it a habit. You can do regular cadence show & tells to talk about current or changing priorities. It will allow you to explain the context. It will make the team feel more engaged in your mission.


#### 8. Treat epics as ADRs

You could go to the extent of treating an epic like an [architectural decision record](https://adr.github.io/).

You could follow a very similar structure to the [ADR adoption process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/adr-process.html#:~:text=in%20the%20future.-,ADR%20adoption%20process,-Every%20team%20member):
  - identify the epic
  - identify the epic owner
  - the epic owner creates the epic in a "proposed" state
  - the epic owner organises a meeting to discuss the epic
  - the team could accept/reject/identify improvements
  - the epic owner updates the epic according to the outcome
  - if positive outcome, the team identifies action points
  - the epic owner assigns people to actions points
  - assigned people create user stories

You could substitute the epic owner with yourself, if you feel confident enough on the topic.
