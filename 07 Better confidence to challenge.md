Leadership positions such as the ones of Product managers/owners, require a high degree of confidence. Yet, assertive behaviours must be positive, proactive and oriented towards resolution. Especially in high collaborative working environments.

You have to recognise your limits and your strengths, so that you can plan and maximise according to your team's potential.

##

Here are the ten(ish) most important things that help me, to find the right path towards conflict resolution.

#### 1. Listen attentively and with "fresh" mind

Listening proactively is the first key to success.

If anyone comes to you with a request, or with an objection, give them the right level of attention. You will immediately be in a better position to take further actions.

Even if you already know the topic, even if you know that it is not feasible or not possible, just give them the space and time to express themselves.

It will be easier for you to push back, if needed, as you will have a solid understanding on what they need/want.


#### 2. Understand the big picture

This is about the context. It is always very useful to put things into perspective.

If you are receiving a specific request or push back, try to understand the context where it is coming from.

It may be a case where the person who is dealing with you, has a better context of, for instance, the business value of the thing they are asking you to deliver.

Or, vice versa, you may have a much better understanding on the current business needs or strategy.

Provide that information to the people who are interacting you, so that they can understand the bigger picture as well.  They will realise that, whatever it is their point, it does not fit with the strategy, and what are the exact reasons.

It is a matter of contextualising what you do and making sure that it is in scope, and that scope is crystal clear to everyone.


#### 3. Ask questions

Ask as many questions as possible to learn as much as possible about the specific matter in discussion.

This may sound simple and obvious, but it is not about you.

It is a win win approach: you learn more and you grow your confidence in taking an informed decision. At the same time, your interlocutor grows its confidence in you because you are showing interest.

To maximise the effect, ask as many technical or specific questions as possible, and keep it non personal.


#### 4. Difference between perspectives

Make sure that whatever discussion you have, it is about competences, ideas and opinions, not about people.

Yes, some people may be more insistent than others, and may try to strengthen their points with their "role" or their subject matter expertise.

Be the first to not make it personal: stick to evidence and facts, and challenge others on those basis.


#### 5. Be prepared

The more competent and prepared you are on a given topic, the higher will be your confidence in pushing back, and your degree of success.

Take time to prepare: do not rush into a conversation. Speed of response is less valuable than its quality.

Take time to ask your peers' expertise or opinions if you need to.


#### 6. Offer alternatives

Offering alternatives instead of saying "no", is a brilliant and efficient strategy.

First of all, it is more cooperative. Second, it shows that you care and you are keen to find a solution to a problem. Third, it grows your credibility amongst your stakeholders.

It might not be possible to always offer an alternative, and in some cases it may be the wrong thing to do. Evaluate your situation attentively.


#### 7. Pick your battles

Some things are not worth fighting for.

Sometimes, it is way easier, faster and less effort to take on a request, put it into the backlog and deliver it at some point.

All the previous points will help you understand what is worth pushing back or not.

Be kind to yourself and to your team. Preserve your energies for those challenges who are worth the effort.


#### ?. Pick the less controversial things?

This is something that can either be productive, or counterproductive.

Pushing back on a less controversial thing is low effort and low risk.

However, if you only push back on minor challenges, and never push back on the hardest problem to solve, you may create a dangerous pattern. People will build a specific level of expectation on you and your team. Then, it will be much harder to challenge when you will be under stress.

My strategy and suggestion is to keep a balance and evaluate each situation: do not go for the easiest push back by default.


#### 8. Know your boundaries: if in doubt, shout!

There might be situations where you may be uncomfortable with some requests or some push backs.

It is important to keep your integrity and professionalism, and not to get down to risky compromises.

If you are not sure about the nature of some requests or you don't feel at ease with them, talk to your immediate peers who have decisional power. Ask for suggestions, challenge your assumptions.

Knowing the bigger picture helps, but at times it is not enough.


#### 9. Be consistent

Whatever strategy and style you decide to go for, be consistent. Apply this with all your colleagues, independently from who they are and what role they are in. Your credibility and reputation will be at the highest.

It is about being equal, offering the same opportunities to everyone. You will prove outstanding leadership skills.


#### 10. Be ruthless: don't be afraid of "the boss"

Probably strictly connected to the point above: apply your consistency to anyone, even if it is your boss.

There are some working environments where this may be more challenging. However, if you are consistent people will respect and trust you.

If you feel constantly afraid to be fired, or you have evident signs that your senior leadership does not appreciate your approach, then ... you are operating in an environment that is not representing the best for you, your career and your personal growth.
