The elements contained within this page are useful to make existing epics more effective.

However, keep them into consideration when you create new epics as well.

##

#### 1. Epic as a user story 

Epics need to include the following:
  - actions (as a ...)
  - goals (I want to ...)
  - business outcomes (so that I can ...)

What is the problem this epic is trying to solve? What is the challenge? What is the opportunity?

For whom is this? Business, customer, internal user?

Why are we solving it? What is the business value of this effort?

In short, the "what", the "who" and the "why" must be well defined.


#### 2. Definition of done

Make sure that the definition of done for an epic addresses the following three questions:
  - has this epic solved our problem? (works in production)
  - has this epic delivered business value? (customer happiness)
  - has this epic increased our competitive advantage? (improved our product)

You will know that your epic is done when the answer to all above three questions will be "yes".


#### 3. Risks and success criteira

When possible, also make sure to include the following:
  - risks
  - when is the goal reached or not

It is important to identify potential risks in advance.

It is also important to be very clear on what is in scope, versus what is not in scope. This will help us avoid scope creep.
