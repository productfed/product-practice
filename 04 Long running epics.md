There are plenty of resources available on books and the internet, on what is an epic.

For the purpose of this page, I will not get into the various definitions and critique.

I will just consider an epic as a container for multiple stories, who belong to the same theme.

I also want to specify that to produce customer value in software development, we deliver user stories, not epics.

##

If you manage a team in medium to high complexity organisations, you may have come across those epics who seem never getting to an and.

If you have not ... consider yourself lucky!

If you have, do not panic.

Long running epics are annoying, as you never seem to have full control on them. Yet, do not blame yourself too much. There is a high likelihood that their existence is due to a wider company culture.

##

For the ones in your control, I have identified four possible causes to long running epics:

  - non correct scoping
  - non correct estimate in terms of effort/time required
  - non correct identification of existing blockers
  - non correct identification of potential dependencies

If you want to try to prevent some of them, here below are ten propositions on things to address.


#### 1. Run spikes for epics

Especially useful if you are creating a new epic.

Also useful if you are re evaluating an existing one.

Running a spike will allow you to investigate, performing a deep dive on the problem space, before defining the scope.

You will be able to identify blockers and risks in advance. You will be able to build a better understanding on the effort required.

You will surface anything that is unknown, any gap that needs to be filled before starting with the stories.


#### 2. Define a clear scope

Build your scope on the outcomes of the spike.

Describe what the epic is for, why it is needed and what is the expected outcome.

Clarify what is in scope, and what is definitely not.

This will allow you to be clear upfront and to manage ambiguity and expectations.


#### 3. Introduce an epic owner

As previously described [here](https://github.com/productfed/product-practice/blob/main/02%20Improve%20backlog's%20clarity.md#4-establish-epic-owners), make it so yourself or one of your team members become the experts on that epic.

The epic owner will act as the main point of reference for that specific epic.


#### 4. Build pairs with a pivot

Make it so, when you have pairs working on the epic, you have one of the two staying for longer.

They will act as a pivot. They will build more experience and will up-skill the next person on the pair, before rotating off.


#### 5. Plan for pairs rotation

Use the following pattern:
  - developer a), stays for sprints 1 and 2 and then rotates off
  - developer b), the pivot, stays for sprints 1, 2, 3 and 4, and then rotates off
  - developer c), rotates in at sprint 3, after developer a) rotates off, stays for sprints 3, 4, 5 and 6 and becomes the pivot after developer b) rotates off
  - developer d), rotates in at sprint 5, will replace developer c) as pivot at sprint 7
  - developer a), rotates in again at sprint 7, replacing developer c)

Keep the pattern consistent and you will achieve much better control on the scope and the outcomes of the epic.


#### 6. Encouraging people to develop themselves

Allowing people to become epic owners, will increase their sense of belonging to the mission.

Some of them will be more suitable for some epics than others. Listen to them and if they have a keen interest for something specific, let them develop and progress. They will help you and the rest of the team to deliver the mission.


#### 7. Review epics durning pre-planning

Pre planning is not just for stories.

Pre planning is useful to keep track and review epics as well.

Check the status, check the progress, see if all the stories are still relevant, if they fall into the scope or not.


#### 8. 5/10 minutes summary before backlog grooming

Before you start the grooming activities with the team, do a quick summary of the epics.

It will help team members to stay informed and up to date.

It will provide a fresh perspective on epics. It will ease spotting any blockers or dependencies during the grooming.


#### 9. Constantly re-consider the relevance of topics

Are your epics still relevant to the topics?

And vice versa, are your topics enough to cover all the epics?

Having a better control on your epics will help you answer those questions.


#### 10. Pay particular attention to the high profile topics

High relevance topics like security or stability, are the ones more subject to never ending epics.

No particular suggestion here, just keep that in mind and do not over obsess on trying to close those epics. It may not be possible, for a long time. They are not in your control.
