How do you approach the challenge of having stories and epics belonging to more than one topic/objective/goal, who need to run in parallel?

Here below are seven recommendations.


#### 1. Find out the balance between negotiable vs. non negotiable

In an ideal world, all the topics should be negotiable. In reality, that is not the truth.

Because of their business relevance or structural importance, some are not something that you can trade off.

Objectives like availability or security, for instance, may be part of core business goals. If not met, they are immediately threatening the entire system.

Therefore, one healthy and useful method is to identify what is negotiable, and what is not.

Team topics, the ones proposed by the team itself, usually have a higher degree of flexibility. This is not to say that they are less important.

Business topics, on the contrary, usually have a lower degree of flexibility. This is not to say that all of them have equal importance, or should have priority over any team goal.

It is a matter of finding the balance, making sure that you keep in play high risk topics, together with lower risk ones.


#### 2. Keep in mind the theory of constraints

Some topics may represent real constraints.

Although the [theory of constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) prescribes some very non flexible steps, it can be useful to consider them.

For instance, identifying what those constraints are, is a valid thing to do. Exploiting them and decide to subordinate everything else, probably less so.

What you can apply is the thinking process behind it:
  - agree on what is non negotiable
  - agree on what negotiable topics can be deprioritised
  - make sure that the ratio is sustainable
  - widely advocate for your decisions
  - be ready to adapt in case something does not got to plan


#### 3. Be consistent

When you find a balance that works, keep it.

If you have 70% of topics coming from the team, and you are still able to deliver on the remaining non negotiable 30% with excellent quality, there is no reason to change.

You may be forced to change, if the size of the non negotiable objectives suddenly becomes much larger. But then, again, it is about finding a new right balance.


#### 4. More topics equals more prestige?

It is tempting and natural to feel that the more topics you handle, the more importance you have. But is it really true?

What if you are handling 7 topics at the same time, but you do it cutting corners?

Is it any better than handling 4 topics really, really well?

Sure, you may argue that handling 7 topics instead of 4, you are delivering more value. But can you confidently say that more quantity equals more value?


#### 5. Focus on quality delivery

Quality code, brings real value to your customers.

Obviously, if you try to deliver quality code and you take 6 months longer than expected, the customer may have a different perception.

But overall, this is another good reason why you should resist to handle too many topics at once. Keep the pace that is sustainable for your team.

Make them pair as much as possible, so you can reduce the risk of single points of failure.

Let them spread the knowledge across the team. They will become more engaged and it will be easier for them to switch from one topic to another, even after a while.


#### 6. Manage expectations

Be clear, honest and open with your management and your stakeholders on the real progress of your team.

Expose the workloads, highlight the complexity of your topics, especially the ones where the work is harder than expected.

You may need to move slower if your team members are not yet familiar with a new topic. Make it so your stakeholders keep it into consideration.

It helps you managing their expectation, it helps them understanding what is feasible to achieve, or not. It can also allow them to budget for more people or more time, or additional training if needed.

It could also help making some of those non negotiable topics, actually become negotiable ... or vice versa, if your team has found out some valuable work that needs addressing as top priority, think about code vulnerabilities.


#### 7. Reduce the stress

Always consider the sustainability of your team and your own workload.

Handling a manageable amount of topics, helps reducing the stress. It shields the team from unnecessary concerns and keeps them focussed on quality.
