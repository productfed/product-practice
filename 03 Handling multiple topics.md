Amongst the topics discussed:
1) find out the balance between negotiable (team?) vs. non negotiable (business?)
2) theory of constraints
3) given that a good part of topics come from teams (quality, delivery speed) and 50% don't get discussed with APO, share more widely, find consistency
4) experience in ops, lower error rates
5) difference between components and team level topics:
  - refactoring
  - certificate handling
  - database monitoring/migration/failover
  - loggregator monitoring/architectural changes
6) incresed feeling of importance the more topics we have
7) risk of encountering "blind spots"
9) finding the balance between topics
10) focussing on quality delivery
11) reducing the stress
12) managing expectations
