There are plenty of resources available on books and the internet, on what is a product backlog.

They all seem to agree on one thing: it is a prioritised list of tasks.
In my opinion though, it is more than that.

I consider the product backlog as the main architecture, that drives the whole development process.

It is a place where, no matter what framework is used, tasks move dynamically and according to priorities.

It is a non static list. Sure, you can create tasks sequentially, but you can move them up or down even independently.

It does not enjoy the same level of dynamism of a sprint backlog, or a kanban board. Yet, you can use it to provide the team with a good sense of the order of priorities. And you should.

To maximise its efficiency, you need to structure it well.

Here below are six points that you can consider, to make it so its structure is solid and functional to your needs.


#### 1. Be consistent

Apply consistency throughout the backlog.

If you use low/medium/level indicators, make sure you assign them to all the cards.

If you use epics and/or labels, make sure you assign them to all the cards as well.

The same applies to story points, t-shirt sizing or any other immediately visible indicator.


#### 2. Manual actions

The automations offered by commercial tools are very basic and limited. Always consider that you will have to spend time performing manual actions.

Communicate often to your team members, what they must include when they create a task or a user story. This will reduce the need for your intervention, over time.


#### 3. Clean it up

Spend time to periodically get rid of whatever is not needed anymore.

We create many cards and some of them end up living forever in the backlog. Don't be afraid to delete what is obsolete or redundant.

If the answer is "we need it, we are going to do it at some point", try to figure out if it's really true. You may need it, sure, but you may need a more up to date version of it. So, try to keep track of those stories, they are the most unhelpful for achieving a healthy backlog.

Keep it clean, consistently. 


#### 4. Make use of available tools

If your backlog management software allows for filters or swimlanes, make use of them.

Also, make use of any other tools that may improve the visibility of specific aspects of your cards.

If your epics have colours, group them together. Everyone will have a more immediate sight of them.


#### 5. Reduce ambiguity

Pay attention to the titles of your stories and tasks.

Make them unambiguous. Encourage your team members to make sure they do the same.

It will help to communicate with stakeholders who are not part of the day to day activities with your team.


#### 6. Establish who controls what

Yes, you own the backlog, but the reality is that other people will take actions on it.

Set clear rules on who can do what, keep everyone accountable, including yourself.
